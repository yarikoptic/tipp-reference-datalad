# tipp-reference

This repository contains the TIPP reference packages as a binary **realease** (and not as individual files since they would be too big). 

The current file can be found from the latest release, tipp.zip. 

For example, the first release put on the github is available at: V2: [https://github.com/tandyw/tipp-reference/releases/download/v2.0.0/tipp.zip](https://github.com/tandyw/tipp-reference/releases/download/v2.0.0/tipp.zip)
